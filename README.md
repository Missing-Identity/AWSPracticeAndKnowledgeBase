# AWS Projects Documentation

This repository serves as a personal note and document storage for AWS projects inspired by the resources from nextwork.org. The primary goal of this repo is to maintain a clean and organized collection of notes and documentation for future reference.

## Purpose

The documentation provided by nextwork.org contains heavy branding, which can detract from the clarity of the information. To address this, I have developed a code solution that removes unnecessary branding elements, resulting in cleaner and more concise notes.

## Features

- **Clean Documentation**: Removes heavy branding from the original documents.
- **Organized Notes**: Stores notes in a structured manner for easy access.
- **Future Reference**: Acts as a personal archive for AWS project insights and learnings.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-projects-docs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd aws-projects-docs
   ```

3. Use the provided scripts to clean and organize your notes.
